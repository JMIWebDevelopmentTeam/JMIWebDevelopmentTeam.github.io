  The Department of Computer Engineering was started in the year 2000. Since its inception, the department has kept on evolving and now has become one of the leading departments at the Faculty of Engineering and Tech.
</font></p>
<p><font size="4" >
Two undergraduate courses are running at the department, namely B.Tech in Computer Engg and B.E. in Computer Engg. Both the courses are fully equipped with the subjects that are currently the need of the industry with the aim to make the students market ready.
Department of Computer Engg. also runs Masters program and has collaborative research with industry on joint projects, along with making constant efforts to improve the quality of placements for the students. We have also been approached by leading companies like Adobe, for collaborative projects.
</font></p>
<p><font size="4" >
Keeping the current market trends in mind, the department of Computer Engg has also started an elective paper for the final year students, titled Embedded System Design.
The Department also runs the Ph.D. program successfully, under which a number of research scholars are working in the fields of Networking, Data Mining, and Artificial Intelligence etc. The Faculty members at the department have produced quite a large number of papers in various National and International Journals and Conferences. The faculty members have also authored a number of books in the field of Computer Engg and are actively involved in taking the department to greater heights.
Apart from the curriculum, the department has actively organized lectures for its students on various technical as well as non-technical topics, which are delivered by professionals from the industry. Since the last two years, the department has successfully organized workshop on Embedded System Design, in which students were provided with a hands-on approach for working on microcontrollers.
</font></p>
<p><font size="4" >
The Department has been working towards placements of its students very diligently. We were fortunate enough to get an accreditation from TCS. With the visit from other companies, most of the students of the department have been placed. Companies like TCS, HCL, HP, Adobe, Arricent, Accenture, BirlaSoft, NewGen etc. have visited the department for campus selection in the recent years.
</font></p>
<p ><font size="4" >
The Department of Computer Engg is also an institutional member of the Computer Society of India, and had opened a student&#39s chapter which successfully conducts an annual cultural cum technical fest &quotAlgorythm&quot and various other events throughout the year. We also have a Linux user group here at the department which is also actively making efforts to improve the student&#39s skills in Linux.
