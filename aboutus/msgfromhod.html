       <font size="4" >   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To fulfil  the growing demand of Computer Engineers in the Government and private sectors, the Department is making best efforts to produce highly trained and capable engineers who can take up the challenges of the real world.</br></br>
 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe two key objectives of the department are to maintain high academic standards and to give due weightage to practical work. The department  has a fine blend of renowned as well as young and dynamic personalities as faculty, who are involved in imparting quality education. The faculty strives to foster and encourage a teaching methodology that is both practical and theoretical in approach. This orientation has led to successful projects and training.
</br></br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe lab facilities are being upgraded from time to time and provide adequate opportunities for the students to learn and innovate . The Department also organizes interactive lectures every week by inviting Alumni and Technocrats from industries for the overall development of students.
</br></br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDepartmental society has been established by the students for the extra curricular activities. This society conducts various technical and cultural events regularly. “Engineers are the creators of the new world”, going with these lines the Department has a fully equipped Project lab to encourage the students to show their creativity. Educational tours and industrial visits are regularly organized to enhance the practical knowledge of the students  with the recent technologies used in the industries.
