        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are grateful to inform that the 15th National Conference of Engineering Council of India (ECI) on the Theme: ‘Preparing Engineers/Technologists for Role in Industry’ which was held on November 10, 2017 at New Delhi was very successful, attended by 25 participants, from JAMIA MILLIA ISLAMIA (Faculty Of Engineering And Technology).

It was inaugurated by Dr. Satya Pal Singh, Hon’ble Minister of State for Human Resources Development (Higher Education). The support to Engineering Council of India is greatly appreciated by all, including the member associations of professional engineers. It has helped ECI in a great measure in furthering its objectives to strengthen the engineering profession in the country so as to better serve the industry and economy.

       <p>
            For accelerated economic growth, massive investments are needed in all sectors. Industry and corporates will require engineers/technologists in large numbers. As several studies have shown, most of the engineers/technologists passing out from technical institutions do not have practical skills to take up jobs in industry and require pre-job training. Many companies have to deploy large amount of funds, time and internal resources in locating, recruiting, training and in trying to retain talent in the absence of availability of 'industry ready' manpower directly from academic institutions in adequate numbers and quality. All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has recently decided that, starting from 2017-18, the engineering students should undergo internship training before taking up jobs, in a manner somewhat similar to medical graduates, so that they can gain practical skills and experience and suitably fit in the desired roles in industry. For this purpose, a major initiative has been taken by AICTE by partnering with Engineering Council of India (ECI) in this regard so that the quality of graduates could be enhanced and thereby their employability. ECI & AICTE have entered into an MoU, for providing “Internship” to the students in all disciplines of technical education to enable them to become employable. ECI shall be facilitating hands-on training/internship for these graduates through its member associations, in their respective stream of engineering. For those engineers/technologists who are already employed, it is important that they undergo Continued Professional Development (CPD) so as to upgrade their knowledge and skills and prepare themselves for required role in the industry. This is necessary in view of rapid technological advancements in all spheres of engineering activities.
