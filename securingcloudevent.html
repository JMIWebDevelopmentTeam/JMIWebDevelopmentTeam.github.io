        <h3 class="well well-sm"style="max-width:160px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></h3>

       <p>
           Cloud services covers a wide range of resources that a service provider delivers to customers
           via the internet. Customers can provision services on an on-demand basis and shut them
           down when no longer necessary. On-demand computing services can save large enterprises
           and small businesses a lot of money, but security and regulatory compliance become difficult.
           He emphasised that these systems may present a variety of potential security risks that could
           be exploited to harm consumers. He discussed the privacy concerns that arise and how we
           can address them effectively.

        <h3 class="well well-sm"><strong>What is cloud service?</strong></h3>

        <p>
            A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from
            a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's
            own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to
            applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="well well-sm"><strong>What is the "Internet of Things"?</strong></h3>

        <p>
            IoT can be described as the connection of physical objects to the Internet and to each other
            through small, embedded sensors and wired and wireless technologies, creating an
            ecosystem of ubiquitous computing. The IoT includes consumer-facing devices, as well as
            products and services that are not consumer-facing. The Internet of Things extends internet
            connectivity beyond traditional devices like desktop and laptop
            computers, smartphones and tablets to a diverse range of devices and everyday things that
            utilize embedded technology to communicate and interact with the external environment, all
            via the Internet.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="well well-sm"style=" max-width:200px;"><strong>IoT Examples:</strong></h3>

        <p>
            Examples of objects that can fall into the scope of Internet of Things include connected
            security systems, thermostats, cars, electronic appliances, lights in household and commercial
            environments, alarm clocks, speaker systems, vending machines and more. Businesses can
            leverage IoT applications to automate safety tasks (for example, notify authorities when a fire
            extinguisher in the building is blocked) to performing real-world A/B testing using networked
            cameras and sensors to detect how customers engage with products.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="well well-sm"style=" max-width:200px;"><strong>Risks:</strong></h3>

        <p>
            Despite numerous benefits these systems create a number of security and privacy risks.<br>
            <strong> 1. Data Breaches</strong><br>
            He cited that the largest breaches haven't involved any such advanced techniques, which
            remain for the most part lab experiments. But the possibility still acts as a brake on what is
            looking like broad enterprise adoption of cloud computing. Clouds represent concentrations
            of corporate applications and data, and if any intruder penetrated far enough, who knows
            how many sensitive pieces of information will be exposed.
            Unfortunately, while data loss and data leakage are both serious threats to cloud computing,
            the measures you put in place to mitigate one of these threats can exacerbate the other.
            Encryption protects data at rest, but lose the encryption key and you've lost the data. The
            cloud routinely makes copies of data to prevent its loss due to an unexpected die off of a
            server. The more copies, the more exposure you have to breaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> 2. Data Loss</strong><br>
            A data breach is the result of a malicious and probably intrusive action. Data loss may occur
            when a disk drive dies without its owner having created a backup. It occurs when the owner
            of encrypted data loses the key that unlocks it. And a data loss could occur intentionally in
            the event of a malicious attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. Account Or Service Traffic Hijacking</strong><br>
            <p>
        Account hijacking sounds too elementary to be a concern in the cloud, but it is a problem.
        Phishing, exploitation of software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow attacks, and loss of
        passwords and credentials can all lead to the loss of control over a user account. An intruder
        with control over a user account can eavesdrop on transactions, manipulate data, provide
        false and business-damaging responses to customers, and redirect customers to a
        competitor's site or inappropriate sites.
            </p>
        <p>
            If your account in the cloud is hijacked, it can be used as a base by an attacker to use the
            power of your reputation to enhance himself at your expense.
        </p>
        <p>
            If credentials are stolen, the wrong party has access to an individual's accounts and systems.
            A service hijacking lets an intruder into critical areas of a deployed service with the possibility
            of "compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability" of those services, the report
            said.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> 4.InsecureAPIs</strong><br>
            A data breach is the result of a malicious and probably intrusive action. Data loss may occur
            when a disk drive dies without its owner having created a backup. It occurs when the owner
            of encrypted data loses the key that unlocks it. And a data loss could occur intentionally in
            the event of a malicious attack.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="well well-sm"><strong>His recommendations for best practices</strong></h3>
<p>
        <strong>Data security</strong><br>
        Participants discussed a number of specific security best practices. He encouraged companies
        to consider these practices:
        First companies should implement security by design by buikding security into their devices at
        the outset , rather than as an afterthought.in addition. Companies should do a privacy or
        security risk assessment , consciously considering the risks presented by collection and
        retention of cosumer information.
        Secondly , companies must ensure that their personnel practices should promote good
        security. Companies should also train their employees about good security practices
        recognizing that technical expertise does not necessarily equate to security expertise.
        Data minimization.
        Companies should examine their data practices and business needs and develop policies and
        practices that impose reasonable limits on the collection and retention of consumer data.
        Data minimization can help guard against two privacy related risks. Companies should also
        consider if it could offer same features while collecting less information.
        With these recommendations on data minimization, he is mindful of the need to balance
        future.
        <br><strong>Data Sharing</strong><br>

        Prof. offerered tips on how to practice defense in depth against hijackings, but the must-do
        points are to prohibit the sharing of account credentials between users, including trusted
        business partners; and to implement strong two-factor authentication techniques "where
        possible."
</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="well well-sm"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
        <p>
            The cloud services and internet of things presents numerous benefits to consumers and has
            potential to change the ways that consumers interact with technology in fundamental ways.
            In future these systems are likely to meld the virtual and physical worlds together in ways
            that are currently difficult to comprehend. From a security and privacy perspective these
            bodies pose particular challenges. As physical objects in our everyday lives increasingly detect
            and share observations about us, consumers will likely want privacy. The designated
            commission will continue to enforce laws, educate consumers and businesses, and engage
            with industry and academics to promote appropriate security and privacy protections. At the
            same time, he urged further self-regulatory efforts on IoT, along with enactment of data
            security and broad based privacy legislation.
